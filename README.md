# 💼 Employee Salary Analysis

**Python · Pandas · Power BI · Data Visualization**

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project performs an **end-to-end employee salary analysis** using **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, followed by **Power BI** for interactive dashboard visualization.

The goal is to uncover salary trends, overtime impact, and high-earning roles through a clean analytics workflow.

---

## 🔍 Key Focus Areas

* Job title–wise salary distribution
* Year-wise salary trends
* Impact of overtime pay on total compensation
* Identification of high-earning roles and outliers

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python – Pandas)

**File:** `employee_salary_analysis.ipynb`

### ✔️ Steps Performed

* Loaded and inspected raw salary data
* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Converted salary columns to numeric format
* Created derived metrics:

  * Total Pay
  * Total Pay Benefits
* Filtered top job roles based on compensation
* Exported a clean dataset for visualization

📌 *The cleaned dataset is optimized for BI-level analysis.*

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)

**File:** `employee_salary_dashboard.pbix`

### 📌 Dashboard Features

* 🗓️ **Year Slicer** (2011–2014)
* 📈 **Job Title–wise Total Base Pay per Year**
* 📊 **Total Salary by Year**
* 🔵 **Scatter Plot:** Overtime Pay vs Total Compensation
* 📌 **KPI Cards:**

  * 💰 Total Base Pay
  * ⏱️ Total Overtime Pay
  * 🎁 Total Pay Benefits
  * 🧾 Total Pay

---

## 📉 Scatter Plot Insight

### Relationship Between Overtime Pay and Total Compensation

This visualization helps to:

* Identify employees with unusually high overtime
* Detect compensation outliers
* Understand how overtime contributes to overall earnings
