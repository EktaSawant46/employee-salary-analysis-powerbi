🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python – Pandas)

File: employee_salary_analysis.ipynb

✔️ Steps Performed:

Loaded and inspected raw salary data

Handled missing & inconsistent values

Converted salary columns to numeric format

Created derived metrics:

Total Pay

Total Pay Benefits

Filtered top job roles based on compensation

Exported clean dataset for visualization

📌 The cleaned dataset is ready for BI-level analysis.

📊 Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)

File: employee_salary_dashboard.pbix

📌 Dashboard Highlights:

🗓️ Year Slicer (2011–2014)

📈 Job Title–wise Total Base Pay per Year

📊 Total Salary by Year

🔵 Scatter Plot:

Relationship Between Overtime Pay and Total Compensation

📌 KPI Cards:

💰 Total Base Pay

⏱️ Total Overtime Pay

🎁 Total Pay Benefits

🧾 Total Pay

📉 Scatter Plot Insight

📍 Relationship Between Overtime Pay and Total Compensation

This visualization helps:

Identify employees with unusually high overtime

Detect compensation outliers

Understand overtime contribution to overall earnings
